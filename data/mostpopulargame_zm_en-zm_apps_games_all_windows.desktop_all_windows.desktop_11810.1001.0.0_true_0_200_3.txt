These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.

Ever since the start of the Great War, the Sources have been contested by the Shadow Species, who claimed the Sources for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe momongas are a small and peaceful tribe of flying squirrels, living on a group of small islands on the river Yana. They make their homes in the hollow trunks of giant Sequoia trees, and generally get out of the way of trouble.\r\n\r\nOne day, the village was raided by a group of owl bandits. Their leader, General Kuton, is a renegade general, brilliant in his old days, but torn apart by the loss of his son to the Ravens. The owls took every momonga and disappeared. All except one - the young Momo barely escaped Kuton’s claws. He was saved by Panda, one of the nomadic pandas that roam the continents. He healed Momo and took to a sanctuary up in the mountains.\r\n\r\nOur adventure begins here - with a little flying squirrel and a lonely panda. Will they be able to stop the forces of evil?\r\n\r\nCheck out http://gametroopers.net for more games about to be released!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH2MLN0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Alien Insects Shooter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.803.13510798885695791.2a426454-8618-4bee-8083-8f403e6d84ef.05e84dcf-d005-4e15-a27d-aae450269d8f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#00540a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32675.13510798885695791.5789486c-84c5-4cb4-a333-3735d1760bd5.8d2791da-272a-4ab5-a579-d1c0b167b19e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#00540a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SkippyAppsPtyLtd.AlienInsectsShooter_kf9hk7mcakwce"],"ContentIds":["be1afad8-6afb-3203-7b40-9f4f635b3b84"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"You were on mission to Mars as an expert astronaut on a assigned mission in the galactic caves... your transportation was destroyed due to Mars storms.

The new versions of the game are much brighter and diverse. Retris is one of the best in our opinion, although one can find dozens of Bricks, Blocks, Pentomino and 1010!-like games in the Internet. But it is still essentially the same game that was originally Quadris (classic puzzle Tetris).\r\n\r\nYou can choose number of figures – 9 as in the classical version; 11 – a mix of three and four bricks; Pentax, 17 – all the figures. You can moderate type of figure movement (fluent/intermittent), initial speed, figure colors (as in Tetcolor). At the same time there are no frills, and classic Tetris and Tetcolor lovers might grow fond of it.\r\n\r\nRetris has two color modes: in the first one all pieces of a certain type consist of blocks of the same color. The bottom part that is not burned is composed of disparate units if mixed colors - the remnants of the thrown shapes.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is when a falling figure is composed of red blocks, and the bottom blocks (made of the fallen ones)  are blue.\r\n\r\nRetris provides an opportunity to show a transparent grid that divides a figure into blocks.\r\n\r\nThe game can show a “phantom” – an identical “twin” of a falling figure to help you see where it is better to place it.\r\n\r\nOne can choose a mode of control type in Quadris: if you prefer to play holding your smartphone or tablet with two hands, you can select a mode in which the control buttons are situated to the left and to the right from the game field.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option \"play with one hand\" in Quadris, the control buttons are placed to the right from the playing field on your smartphone or tablet screen.\r\n\r\nYou can compete with other players as in many other puzzle games. It is possible to play anonymously or to register and get your unique nickname. After that your results get into the global chart.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the auto-save function if your game is interrupted by a call or any other program switch on the smartphone!\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n- Create horizontal lines using the falling blocks;\r\n- When you make a line of blocks, it is cleared from the screen;\r\n- The game is over when the blocks pile up and reach the top of the screen;\r\n- You get more points for completing multiple lines at once.\r\n\r\nYou can play the new version of Quadris either online and offline. The game may be of interest both to adult fans of the classic Tetris game and to attract the younger generation, it is as easy to use as educational online games.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of classic puzzle games – Tetris and other related puzzle games like Quadris, Pentax, etc. – has been repeatedly studied by scientists. If one believes their opinion, downloading a free puzzle game (like Quadris or Tetris), you get both a free shrink and a free nutritionist – it is believed that classic puzzle and logic games may relieve stress, may help to ease one’s condition after psychological problems and may reduce the risk of overeating by switching attention to the game. As opposed to the \"shooters\", Quadris and other classic puzzles can calm, giving a feeling that you put your life in order and under control along with the blocks on the playing field.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and join the wonderful company of smart puzzle-crackers!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4N1Z4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"City Common Raven Hunter 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64048.13510798887460425.59a2c2a4-c00a-4073-8a3f-7a691d0a7b85.9ea6018a-d412-40cc-9c0e-3bcf944e551d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18553.13510798887460425.96079cdd-aa30-4f7a-b36f-ae05f4c53b7f.b62877df-f927-484e-8e22-6c8f6fa612f3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21106.13510798887460425.8d1b7522-9ffd-40a6-8dff-3a38f7b431dc.1c99eea9-5096-4700-8e8f-def2bf55bc55","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["34335TopiTapiGames.CityCommonRavenHunter3D_wa68eadphfe3r"],"ContentIds":["199e72bc-9e65-e92c-4911-4ad63bfef059","1a669b97-3c8b-7a31-4889-6a9d48d7e244"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Shoot the crows those are destroying the environment before they can fly over and destroy the environment, it's challenging, even crows are challenging, shoot them and clean the environment.\r\nShoot fast and wisely to unlock next level of your success and efficiency will also allow you to unlock new birds for shoot.

So dive into the ocean and be a part of this adventure as an Angry Whale as this orca knows no stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal simulators give you the opportunity to observe the wildlife and sea animal life from a close perspective. Angry Whale Simulator 2016 will give you that chance of controlling a whale that attacks and eat underwater animals and humans alike.

So feed the whale by attacking the targets and make sure you stay out of the range of hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngry whale needs food to survive and you have multiple missions that include attacking people on the beach and animals in the sea. The killer whale is out on the hunt. Use the on screen navigation controls to swim in water and reach the target. Happy hunting\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the Angry Whale Simulator 2016 game.

This is absolute madness as the block has been turned into a dead zone jungle. It is time to defend national pride and bring in the big guns. This invasion calls for direct action!\r\n\r\nIt is up to heroic little you to defend the neighbourhood. In this epic turret defence game you are building an army of block defenders with unique skills. You will need to use your fantasy and imagination to conquer the Blockheads once and for all!\r\n\r\nPOWERFUL WEAPONS\r\nLuckily you have some toys to your disposal that can push back the alien invasion.\r\n\r\nBouncer:\r\nBouncers throw tiny bombs that do quite some splash damage. Cheap to build, but has limited range and is best used in large numbers. Summoning bouncers is always a good idea!\r\n\r\nSniper:\r\nShoots enemies from a great distance with a powerful shot. This tower unit has a very wide range and can easily snipe baddies from a far. Unfortunately the sniper does need quite some time to reload itself, but it remains your strongest long range shooter.\r\n\r\nFan:\r\nThe fan unit is not developed to provide a cool breeze in the heat of battle. Instead this fan is very powerful and slows down the approaching army of enemies with a sonic blast. Your other units can then take time and annihilate the competition! Range is quite limited so it is best to place this unit at junctions and close to your other towers.\r\n\r\nTesla turret:\r\nEvery strategy game needs a tesla coil right? This is the most powerful of your units, but also one of the most expensive. It has good range and does a lot of damage. Reload time is relatively quick and it fries enemies with a powerful electrical laser. This is hell-fire of the highest order!\r\n\r\nTurbolaser (from a certain galaxy):\r\nIn later levels you will need this powerful anti air unit as it is the only Block Defender that can shoot flying enemy types. Its X - ray range is limited and you will most likely need a couple of these to counter incoming squadrons. Luckily they are relatively cheap to produce. It can not defend against ground based targets.\r\n\r\nECONOMICS\r\nThese weapons should be sufficient and up to the task. The biggest challenge however, especially in later levels are your economics. You will find that you might need to sell units on the fly in order to purchase new ones. Robots and Blockheads are relentless in their march and it is key to pay attention to where the threat is coming from and what the best counter measures are!\r\n\r\nIn short Block Defender offers a real challenge and with episode unlocks there is always something new just around the corner. And you know what they say - a strategy game a day keeps the brain doctor away!\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n+ 3 worlds to conquer\r\n+ 30 challenging levels to complete\r\n+ Defend against land, sea and air units \r\n+ 5 powerful units to master (4 ground / 1 air)\r\n+ Many different enemy types to defeat\r\n+ Lite or premium game-play\r\n+ Unique graphical style","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

In order to do that your child has to learn English letters and combine them into words, which represent the names of the captured animals. \r\n\r\nIt’s not a big secret that many kids can face difficulties learning to read in English, because English letters in real words have different pronunciation rules in comparison with their sounds in the English alphabet. \r\n\r\n“Learn to Read & Save the Animals” educational game offers efficient Phonics techniques in order to learn how to read in English. During the process of playing the educational game the children will hear the sound of each English letter in exactly the same way as it’s pronounced in the shown word. \r\n\r\nIt allows your child to understand the rules of English word reading on the subconscious level. Kid will simply feel how to pronounce the English words, without suffering and trying to find the transcription of the word in thick English dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThe game offers 3 educational levels free of charge.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDH784","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Defend Your Life!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30910.9007199266338655.e68c75ba-f36c-4af1-905d-bfea017ca6f2.55900408-b966-4849-b357-ba11499d5dcb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45550.9007199266338655.5c846eda-62f0-451b-b6a7-23b76d944ffb.13be31d6-6961-4eef-aba5-87fef8481300","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5093.9007199266338655.1ee1f196-74bf-4aed-86d6-62f17dfb97df.54c38a0d-65ff-439c-a110-7c18a85d834c","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53337.9007199266338655.4d09f5f4-962e-4378-b8d2-d7514f81c327.2c73d87c-695d-4213-be25-aa2d1706edc8","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47106.9007199266338655.17a614a4-4d29-4db3-af20-ffddbf32c302.6689b5fb-0ec4-4952-a8fc-14f2a70bac05","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56466.9007199266338655.090bf73b-4c7a-469b-b329-37b710af1a58.12fd5c17-4105-4e81-8deb-afa3deb50529","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["22C9D1A5.DefendYourLife_a5cdzd7e64818"],"ContentIds":["c10cf993-5ddf-d8b6-12c2-30e035bc111a","95cd03ee-ac0b-7e77-3be8-bfd0b62b9c95"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Take the role of clever commander and fight for the most precious aspect of human being.

The coins can be pocketed into any pocket.\r\n\r\nAs there are a huge number of variations in the rules exists so this App 'tries' to support 2 types of popular Carrom game play i.e. 'Family-Point' and 'Professional' and implements only those Carrom rules which I found practical to implement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4. Max number of rounds for 'Family-Point' game is 5 while 'Professional' mode game is 8. Player can always 'Give up' game during rounds play then game will declares game winner!\r\n5. App provides user to save up to maximum of 9 game plays. \r\n\r\nNote: I have recently released online version of this game app name 'Carrom online', if you are interested to play online please do try that app.\r\n\r\nKindly rate this app that would encourage me to come with new updates and improvements in future.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5LGTN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ball Color Switch","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57539.13510798887179517.49c76e8c-e89b-4906-9971-0fb4d22b880a.fc0214e2-b0be-40e9-b10b-37632f1f2cd1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24245.13510798887179517.765becde-e083-4b02-a0c8-828535c0b40e.77fe73fd-cc05-41f3-8ec0-e95968b14ecc","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37124.13510798887179517.aed2d727-9cd1-4b4f-845c-c7b76e0f5c03.cbf358eb-fba2-4686-b672-1a25181c2e22","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45446.13510798887179517.4e3d07a4-bc66-4ed0-847f-51ba5bbe2ce5.95c1da38-2e6e-4380-9d36-65159f6cad66","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["40517HUTStudio.BallColorSwitch_5z9e7j7fdynx6"],"ContentIds":["b0aefa4f-3eab-4a17-7cb3-e423ba5d2d5f","b251faf8-4c54-b081-317b-a2e0fa0f05cf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Tap to jump the ball carefully through each obstacle and your ball will switch color with some power ups. 70 new balls. 650 new levels, 08 game modes for Color Switch: Racing, Split, Color Swap, Color Fly, Challenge, Reverse, Cave, Normal.
