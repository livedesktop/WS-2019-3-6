Carrom is a similar to Billiards or Table Shuffleboard game however instead of pool cues you use your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to flick a striker to hit and pocket a playing coin. The coins can be pocketed into any pocket.\r\n\r\nAs there are a huge number of variations in the rules exists so this App 'tries' to support 2 types of popular Carrom game play i.e. 'Family-Point' and 'Professional' and implements only those Carrom rules which I found practical to implement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

As you may know, most Spider Solitaire games are not winnable even though you play your best. That's where we come in. We included in this game only winnable deals for all types of games: with one suit, with 2 suits and 4 suits. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly. Now you can truly enjoy the game. \r\nDownload and have fun playing Spider Solitaire Mobile!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Solvable deals that have at least one winning solution\r\n✓ 1 suit, 2 suits and 4 suits games\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop or Tap to move cards\r\n✓ Unmovable cards will be greyed out\r\n✓ Nice sound effects and music\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ The goal of the game is to create sets of cards that start with a king, queen and jack and end with an ace. Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P9FT3QJN0PK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hearts Free !","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57209.14143981274591232.de1598a9-9189-4d06-982c-fc78abf82536.c0968af1-eafc-4282-9324-e5ce1510dd87","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28767.14143981274591232.bd4c90dd-8b28-406d-a558-a5845ada8d25.99ec4dd7-2abf-48af-a480-a8e041dfc860","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.317.14143981274591232.9eddbfa3-322f-4c32-8f2a-b316cc5f3166.f016148c-3194-494c-8236-77f3b73af2e1","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13476.14143981274591232.eaee285c-9949-4919-890e-a614d604f4ee.e2c0fc54-d258-4516-9ab8-5b4b523beb58","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29130.14143981274591232.f07ee5e8-df40-407b-b88a-c2b8623d4680.4db1381a-4c77-42e7-b4b7-485c8dfc388c","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22726.14143981274591232.6c378b8f-c1f0-4c30-bd09-e85c99dafbb1.57575fa8-256a-4718-8105-291173f5e000","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45451.14143981274591232.25922f65-9017-4998-930f-0d8e0cff2b4b.a3eb29a9-1d3f-4b4e-ae9b-9d33e7b54ef9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17005.14143981274591232.22133da3-02b5-4449-8dd6-44fcde02342d.d4739618-52a6-49a1-acfd-d12403afce44","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#22903B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44083.14143981274591232.942f09a6-6b9b-4e83-9240-36f3fe7e4582.6047e36a-adbe-4f4b-80d4-253ea858631e","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17323.14143981274591232.942f09a6-6b9b-4e83-9240-36f3fe7e4582.5afdbed0-b135-4dd2-bcc1-a52d6d2cff2a","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.HeartsFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["43500890-7699-80e0-7261-c81f77db2642","5bb880bb-2d79-2b55-3ae7-ef6d6a4156d4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Hearts is a beautiful free version of the famous trick-taking card game.

of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money. You can turn off the payment feature by disabling in-app purchases in your device's settings, or reach us at support@ninjakiwi.com for help. City data is organized individually, so if you share multiple cities on one device through multiple accounts, do note that your IAP will only apply to the city active during purchase.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MSV724DLKNS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Words Crush Friends","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15134.13820674726655619.a0ccd2c8-25f4-4fdc-b0c0-3923d3aab975.2b5e5f99-74ef-4708-bb77-5fa36f9f8579","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42497.13820674726655619.a0ccd2c8-25f4-4fdc-b0c0-3923d3aab975.c9465941-928b-4a9d-b31c-943cfe24340a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15134.13820674726655619.a0ccd2c8-25f4-4fdc-b0c0-3923d3aab975.2b5e5f99-74ef-4708-bb77-5fa36f9f8579","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["57591LegendsSonicSagaGame.WordsCrushFriends_78eft1qs6c52t"],"ContentIds":["f4e1cc42-4d43-6a1e-e29d-5a6b695ee0a8","8827fa78-5e54-c956-f223-31e779fd6e1c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Here comes the KING of BRAIN TEASERS from the maker of \"Roll the Ball: slide puzzle\", \"Block!\" & \"Pipe Lines : Hexa\".
